## Pre-trained Trained models

The official download of the pre-trained model can be placed in the current directory. If you store the weights in a different directory, you will need to change the corresponding path in the code.



## Usage

1. Clone the repository, and download the pre-trained  models, put them into ./ folder. 

2. And then run the code：python DVPT_XX_train.py. Note that the hyperparameters and paths should be set beforehand
